        description: "A personal project, I created this example advertising poster for a ship from the game Star Citizen. Using the program GIMP I was trying to clearly display ship specifications while keeping in the angular design language of the ship itself. Contrast and a clear message were top priority when creating this design. All text and images were taken from the official Star Citizen website, this was purely an exercise in visuals."

        img: capacityImg,
        description: "Professional Project: The first in a series of datasheets created for a supplement manufacturing company in a professional capacity, the datasheet aims to explain the topic of capsule capacity in lehman's terms. These datasheets get sent to customers by the sales team so that they have a clear, standardised explanation, saving the sales team from repeatedly explaining the same concepts. Clarity was of utmost importance for this project. Created in Figma."

        img: extractsImg,
        description: "Professional Project: The second in the datasheet series, I wanted to make the sheets easily distinguishable from each other while still appearing to be part of a series. In order to achieve this I used a similar design with slightly different dimensions for the two sections. Created in Figma."

        name: 'G&G Datasheet #3: Purity',
        img: purityImg,
        description: "Professional Project: For the third piece in this series I was particularly concerned with showing a difference to the extracts data sheet (#2) as they are very similar in layout. To ensure that it was easy for users to tell them apart I inverted the colours while retaining the same overall design. Created in Figma."

        name: 'G&G Datasheet #4: Restrictions',
        img: restrictionsImg,
        description: "Professional Project: The last in the datasheet series, there was a different issue posed by the Restrictions. As there are three key areas in this topic I needed to set them out clearly and make customers aware of what they should look out for at a glance. To do this I used columns down the centre of the page, tying the datasheet to the others in the series by using the same fonts and colours. Created in Figma."

        img: gamingImg,
        description: "Professional Project: This project is part of an ongoing series of work requiring the production of example labels for food supplements to inspire customers. To capture the essence of the gaming supplement market I decided to lean into the concept of 'biohacking' which is becoming more popular in the health and performance market. Bright colours were used in the label to catch attention and a 'glitchy' effect was created across the lable, particularly around the word 'hack'. Gaming supplements are very performance focused so the language used is geared towards winning, using terms relevant to the industry. Created in Figma."

        img: mushroomImg,
        description: "Professional Project: Another supplement label design, I opted for a much cleaner, simpler design for a cleaner simpler product. The labels are designed using official MHRA documents to ensure that they would be legally compliant if there were a real product and this includes the use of logos in the required scale and a white box for batch numbers and use by dates Created in Figma.."
